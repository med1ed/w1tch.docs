# How To Install

All lua scripts are installed in the `%programdata%\Requiem\Data\Lua\` `OwnLuaFolder\main.lua` and you can find lua scripts at [website](https://w1tch.net/files/category/6-lua/) or in [discord](https://discord.com/channels/837707108894900234/1066395105411481701)

!!!warning
If the lua is in an archive, you need to extract it from the archive.\
