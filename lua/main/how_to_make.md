# How To Make

### How to start making a Lua script

1. First, let's create a folder for our lua script.\

2. Create a txt file and rename it to main.lua\

3. Now we can see in the Lua Manager section whether our lua file was found or not. If your script is not there, click `Reload Scripts`\

Now we can see that the lua is loaded and we can start doing something.

4. Let's open the lua file in any text editor *(I will use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)* for convenience) and go to the next step.
