## Special Thanks

* **k1tty**, for her awesome documentation for D2Lua.
* **thelivingdemon**, for help in creating an FAQ.
* **Big & Fresh**, for your help in creating a description for the menu functionality
* **topIon**, for helping me with some networking questions.
* **Antrix**, special thanks to the fact that after so many years of working on the menu and many problems, the w1tch project has not closed and continues to develop. Although this has nothing to do with documentation, if it weren’t for him, he wouldn’t exist.
